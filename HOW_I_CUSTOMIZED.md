This project simulates a Databricks Lakehouse workflow for fresher data engineers.

- Bronze → Silver → Gold dataflow stored under `data/`
- Works locally with Pandas and optionally PySpark if available
- Includes CLI (`src/pipeline.py`) and runnable notebooks under `notebooks/`
- Suitable as a GitHub portfolio sample: small, fast, and easy to follow
